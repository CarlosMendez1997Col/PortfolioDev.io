<h5 align="justify"> Cadastral and Geodesic Engineer, MSc in Geosciences and Environment at S√£o Paulo State University (UNESP), with professional experience in the leadership of technical-scientific teams, offering useful solutions for modeling, forecasting, analysis and decision making in areas related with: </h5>

<h5 align="justify">
 Hydroenergy and renewable energies: 
 
- Evaluation and simulation of inputs and reserves in hydroelectric power plants referring to Daily Useful Volume (Mm3), Energy Useful Volume (kWh), Energy Inputs (kWh), Flow Inputs (m3/s), 95 PSS Energy Inputs (kWh) and 95 PSS Flow Inputs (m3/s) using Artificial Intelligence algorithms such as: Auto Regressive Neural Networks (NNAR), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and ResCNNN.</h5>


<h5 align="justify">
 Hydrometeorology:
 
- Evaluation of extreme hydrometeorological phenomena such as droughts and low water periods, using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), in reference to hydrological terms such as water scarcity, water stress and water availability. </h5>


<h5 align="justify">
Climate Change:
 
- Evaluation of climate change scenarios SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SPP5-8.5 and bioclimatic projections using Global Climate Models (GCM) CCma-CanESM2, MOHC-HadGEM2-ES and MIROC-MIROC5 in ArcGIS API for Python and ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript.</h5>

 <h5 align="justify">
  Water Resources:
  
- Monitoring and control of water resources, surface and groundwater, water balance using satellite images in Cloud-Computing systems such as Google Earth Engine (GEE) and JavaScript language.
- Hydrological analysis of HydroSHEDS, HydroATLAS, HydroBASINS, HydroLAKES, HydroRIVERS, Global Lakes and Wetlands Database (GLWD) y Global River Classification (GloRiC) in ArcGIS API For Python y Google Earth Engine.</h5>

 <h5 align="justify">
  Agrometeorology:
  
- Forecasting and evaluation of agrometeorological variables (precipitation, temperature, soil moisture) applying the models (AgrometShell, APSIM and DSSAT). </h5>

<h5 align="justify">
 GIS and cartography:
 
- Development of basic and thematic cartography, web maps and Apps in ArcGIS online using ESRI tools. </h5>


<h5 align="justify"> In my professional career, I have a solid experience in the acquisition and geoprocessing of geospatial data obtained through satellite imagery, aerial photography, drone, radar, etc., which allows me to offer a wide portfolio of useful solutions for spatial and temporal analysis, data management and decision making, using Python | ArcGIS API for Python | Google Earth Engine (GEE) | Javascript | ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript |R - Rstudio | HTML and C++.
