## Description

Repository builded in `Arcgis for Python` and `ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript`.

Each chapter is described below:

1. The first chapter, geoprocessing `NetCDF` files and convert them to `CRF` (Cloud Raster Format).
```HTML

``` 
2. The second chapter, analyze trends/patterns and calculate `Multidimensional Anomaly`, `Trend Raster` and `Predict Using Trend Raster`.
```HTML

```
3. The third chapter, shows some animations and timelines of `19 Bioclimate Projections of WorldClim` using `ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript`. 
```HTML

```
4. The fourth chapter, share the links of original NetCDF files.
