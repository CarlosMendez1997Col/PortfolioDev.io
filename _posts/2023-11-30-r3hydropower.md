## Description

Repository builded in `Arcgis for Python` and `R`.

Models: `Neural Network Auto Regression (NNAR)`
        `Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)`
        `Convolutional Neural Network (ResCNN)`

Each section is described below:

1. The first and second sections, forecasting data with `NNAR` and `LSTM`.

* Data
* Useful Volume
* Useful Volume Percent (%)
* Affluent Flow
* Defluent Flow
* Natural Flow
* Stored Energy 
* Affluent Natural Energy
* Energy Generation

Data processed in time series formats are available at: 

* HPP Capivara: [link](https://arcg.is/1u158D) 
* HPP Chavantes: [link](https://arcg.is/1O1Wq11)
* HPP Jurumirim: [link](https://arcg.is/1WTWX)

### The data used for build the time series and the NNAR neural network, include information of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration. Available in:

Precipitation:[link](https://arcg.is/149qym3)

Potential Evapotranspiration:[link](https://arcg.is/0L9iSy0)

## Credits and repository of data
