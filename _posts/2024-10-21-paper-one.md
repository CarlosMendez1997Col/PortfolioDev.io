Abstract


Spatial and temporal forecasts of the processes that occur in the hydrological cycle in order to project scenarios of moderate, severe and extreme droughts represent a major challenge in the planning, management and monitoring of water resources. In order to mitigate the possible impacts of droughts on the natural environment, civil society and biodiversity resulting from climate change and global warming, Machine Learning (ML) methods can support this task by combining spatial and temporal analysis models of future drought episodes. This dissertation investigated the modeling and hydrological forecasting of hydrometeorological phenomena such as droughts and dry spells in the Paranapanema River Basin (PRB) for the period 2023-2025. The PRB is a region that provides hydrological, energy and agricultural resources, located in southeastern Brazil, which has suffered several problems related to water deficit and stress, as well as droughts and dry spells in the last 10 years. For these reasons, geospatial technologies, such as remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), were applied to generate time series of precipitation and Potential Evapotranspiration (ETP) between 2001 and the beginning of 2023 for a total of 22 Hydrological Planning Units (HPUs) in the PRB. Subsequently, an Autoregressive Neural Network (NNAR) was used to predict the monthly precipitation and ETP averages for the HPUs between 2023 and 2025, finding possible periods of water deficit in the central and northern regions of the PRB for the months of May, June, July and August 2024 and part of 2025. Similarly, the Standardized Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) was calculated on quarterly and six-monthly scales, based on the forecast developed by the NNAR network in the HPUs, showing possible impacts on the agricultural, energy and social sectors as a result of probable prolonged periods of droughts and dry spells in the PRB. Finally, it was possible to conclude that the accuracy of the NNAR network was low (errors between 60 and 100 millimeters) in the prognosis phase, which does not guarantee the possible occurrence of droughts in the PRB, but provides a preliminary diagnosis of them with a view to adequate monitoring and control of water resources.
