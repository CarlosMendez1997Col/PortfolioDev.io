## Description

Repository builded in `Google Earth Engine (GEE)` and `Javascript`.

Each section is described below:

- First section, calculate NVDI, MNDWI and AWEI index
  ```html
  <script>
  https://github.com/CarlosMendez1997Col/Monitoring-water-resources-using-Google-Earth-Engine-and-Javascript/tree/main/01.%20Nvdi%2C%20Mndwi%20and%20Awei
  <script>
  ```
- Second section, analyze surface water bodies (watersheds, rivers and lakes)
  ```html
  <script>
  https://github.com/CarlosMendez1997Col/Monitoring-water-resources-using-Google-Earth-Engine-and-Javascript/tree/main/02.%20Surface%20Water
  <script>
  ```
- Third section, analyze precipitation and rainfall in time series (monthly and yearly)
  ```html
  <script>
  https://github.com/CarlosMendez1997Col/Monitoring-water-resources-using-Google-Earth-Engine-and-Javascript/tree/main/03.%20Precipitation%20and%20rainfall
  <script>
  ```
- Fourth section, shows spatial and temporal variations in river levels
  ```html
  <script>
  https://github.com/CarlosMendez1997Col/Monitoring-water-resources-using-Google-Earth-Engine-and-Javascript/tree/main/04.%20Hidrology
  <script>

- Fifth section, calculate water balance and analyze droughts
  ```html
  <script>
  https://github.com/CarlosMendez1997Col/Monitoring-water-resources-using-Google-Earth-Engine-and-Javascript/tree/main/05.%20Water%20balance%20and%20drought
  <script>
  ```
- Sixth section, analyze reservoir levels and groundwater
